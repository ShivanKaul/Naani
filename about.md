My name is Shivan Kaul Sahib (Hi!). I'm a student of software engineering at McGill University in Montreal. But this blog is not about [me](http://shivankaulsahib.me).  

...  

My grandmother's name is Indra Kaul. This is her life story, uploaded in a periodic fashion. I'll try to be fairly regular in my transcribing sessons with her.  

Hosted (with love, apparently) by GitHub Pages and Jekyll.
