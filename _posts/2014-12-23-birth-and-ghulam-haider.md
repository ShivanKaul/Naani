The first thing you must understand is that there wasn't any girl in the house. Some of them were born but they were stillborn. When my older brother was born my grandmother got really upset.

To get to Jammu took 2 days and 2 nights (Banihal pass didn't exist). Raghunath mandir was in Jammu. So my Daadi made the trip to tie a prayer thread in order to pray for a girl. And I was then born.

I was given a lot of love by her. 

At the age of 1, I contracted some disease of the eye. I don't know what it was. The doctors said no light could fall on my eyes. But my grandmother made my mother sit inside a dark room for 3 months and made her take care of me.

At the age of 3 years, I went to Sopore (a small city south of Srinagar) to visit my mother's family. My mother had kept a pot of boiling milk on the stove, and went to look after my brother. I went to take the pot, and drank the milk. I burned my throat and tongue and oesophagus and my chest. Some doctors said I wouldn't survive, because I couldn't eat anything. Dr Omkar Nath said that a dripper filled with milk had to be used to drop milk, one drop by one drop, into my throat. For 1 month. Even after that I couldn't eat solid food for 6 months after that. I lisped for the rest of my childhood because of my burned tongue. I still do sometimes.

I lived for the next 5 years being loved by my Daadi. And then she contracted double pneumonia and died. On her deathbed she told her bahus to treat me as a sister. Till this date they treat me as a sister, in honour of that wish.

My father used to work as a doctor at the Central Jail. There used to be two parties, Sher (Lion Party, led by Sheikh Abdullah) and Bakr (Lamb) parties. Sher Party was in power, and they used to send politicians from the Bakr party to Central Jail under charges of sedition. My father was sympathetic to the Bakr Party, and ensured that the prisoners got proper food. Some people didn't like that, and a complaint went to Sher-e-Kashmir (Sheikh Abdullah). He soon got transferred to Shigar, which was on the India-Pakistan border (now it is a part of Pakistan). It was a 15 day journey on donkey-back. My mother, my sister, my younger brother and I went along; my oldest brother stayed behind for his studies. 

EPISODE: GHULAM HAIDER

My grandfather used to have a cousin who used to do trade between Gilgit and Srinagar, before he died. Shigar was in between these two places, and this cousin had friends in Shigar. My grandfather wrote these friends some letters telling them of my father's transfer to Shigar, and asked them to take care of him when he came there. The story is that one of these friends was Ghulam Haider. When my father got to Shigar, and met him, he was struck by the resemblance that this Ghulam Haider bore to my grandfather's uncle. The rumour eventually developed that my grandfather's uncle had had another wife in Shigar, a Muslim wife, and their son was Ghulam Haider. I don't know if this is true. It's very scandalous, though.
