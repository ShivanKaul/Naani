title:  #2: Attack on Shigar
---

Ghulam Haider took good care of us. He was the [*wazir*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wazir) (the advisor to the king; vizier). The king was a TB patient. My father, as the civil doctor of Shigar, treated him. 

 After a year of us living there, there was an attack on Shigar by Chhatralis of Pakistan.
